// Bubble sort is considered the most basic sorting algorithm in Computer Science. It works by starting at the first element of an array and comparing it to the second element:

// If the first element is greater than the second element, it swaps the two.
// It then compares the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and so on.
// In this way, the largest values ‘bubble’ to the end of the array.
// Once it gets to the end of the array, it starts over and repeats the process until the array is sorted numerically.
// Implement a function that takes an array and sorts it using this technique.

// NOTE: DO NOT use JavaScript’s built-in sorting function (Array.prototype.sort).

function bubbleSort(array) {
// iterate over array
for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    // assign a variable to index
    var findSpot = array[i];
}
// compare first element if value greater than the second element and so on until value is not greater then being compared to
if (findSpot > array[i])
    // if not
        // takes that spot
// It then compares the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and so on.
// Once it gets to the end of array, recurse until the array is sorted numerically. 
}
// I - input
// O - sorted array
// C - cannot use .sort
// E - array contains a non numerical value, array is less than 1, 

// thoughts
    // push into a obj to compare?
        // value?
        // position?
